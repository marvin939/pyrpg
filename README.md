# Pygame RPG
This is an RPG game that I'm working on. Right now I'm trying to get camera rotations and rendering right...
without using test cases (it's horrible! Don't do it!).

## Requirements:
* Pygame 1.9.3
* Python 3.5
* [Gameobjects](https://github.com/apress/beg-python-games-dev-2ed)

## Running the game
Run `camera_test.py`

## Controls:
Cursor keys (`UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT`) for movement.

`J` and `K` to Rotate camera.
